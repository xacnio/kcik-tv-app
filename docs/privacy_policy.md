# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

## 1. Introduction

KCIKTV ("we", "our", or "us") is an open-source Android TV and mobile client for the streaming platform Kick.com. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is handled.

**Key Point:** KCIKTV is a third-party client. We do not own or operate Kick.com. When you use this app, you are also interacting with Kick's services directly.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1. Personal Information
We **do not** collect, store, or share any personal identification information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) on our servers. All interaction happens directly between your device and Kick.com.

### 2.2. Analytics and Usage Data
We use anonymous analytics to improve the application's performance and user experience.
*   **Anonymity:** All data collected is strictly anonymous and aggregated. We cannot identify individual users from this data.
*   **No Personal Data:** No personally identifiable information (PII) is shared with our analytics providers.
*   **Opt-Out:** You can opt-out of analytics in the app settings at any time.

### 2.3. Login Credentials & Security
If you choose to log in, your authentication credentials (tokens) are stored strictly locally on your device.
*   **Encryption:** All sensitive data, including authentication tokens, is encrypted using Android's Keystore system before being stored.
*   **Direct Transmission:** Your credentials are sent directly to Kick.com API endpoints. We do not act as a middleman and never see or store your password.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This application acts as a client for **Kick.com**. By using this app, you acknowledge that your interactions (watching streams, chatting, following channels) are processed by Kick.com according to their [Privacy Policy](https://kick.com/privacy-policy).

We also use the following third-party services which may handle technical data:
*   **Blerp:** Used for sound alerts and interactions within the app. This feature is **optional** and disabled by default. [Blerp Privacy Policy](https://blerp.com/privacy-policy)

## 4. App Permissions

The app requests the following permissions to provide its core functionality:

*   **Internet (`INTERNET`):** Required to fetch streams, chat, and API data from Kick.com.
*   **Camera (`CAMERA`):** Required for scanning QR codes to log in on TV devices. This permission is only used during the scanning process and no images are stored.
*   **Query Packages (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`):** Used to check for installed browsers and other applications to ensure links (e.g., YouTube, Twitter) open in their respective native apps for a better user experience.
*   **Network State (`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`):** Used to optimize video quality based on connection status.
*   **Install Packages (`REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`):** Used for the in-app auto-update feature.
*   **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`):** Required for background audio playback.
*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):** Used for playback controls and update alerts.
*   **Wake Lock (`WAKE_LOCK`):** Prevents the screen from sleeping while watching content.
*   **Vibration (`VIBRATE`):** Haptic feedback for interactions.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## 6. Data Deletion

Since we do not store your data on our servers, there is nothing for us to delete. You can clear your local data by clearing the app's storage in Android settings or logging out, which removes all locally stored tokens.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
